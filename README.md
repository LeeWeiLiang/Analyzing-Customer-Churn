# Recommendations & Next Steps

Prioritize Customer Retention in California: Due to the state's highest churn, focus efforts on retaining customers in California. Consider implementing targeted retention strategies such as personalized offers, loyalty programs, or improved customer service. (Retargeting)

Analyze why monthly contracts have a higher churn rate compared to yearly contracts.

Develop tailored strategies for customers who meet these specific criteria(Not in a Group Plan, Aged 50, with Account Length of 12 Months or Less)

Consider promo strategies to reduce the average extra data charges for customers who are not on an unlimited data plan

Improve customer service quality, particularly for customers using monthly contracts and direct debit payment methods, as they tend to have higher churn rates.
