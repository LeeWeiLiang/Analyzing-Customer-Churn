# Recommendations & Next Steps

Pay special attention to regions with high churn rates, such as California. Investigate the specific issues in those areas and tailor your services and offers to meet local needs.

Analyze why monthly contracts have a higher churn rate compared to yearly contracts.

Improve customer service quality, particularly for customers using monthly contracts and direct debit payment methods, as they tend to have higher churn rates.
